# ML-Mini-Projects
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks showcasing various machine learning projects using different ML algorithms. Each project demonstrates practical applications of ML techniques, covering data preprocessing, model training, feature selection, feature scaling, evaluation, prediction, and optimization.

üìÇ Notebooks Overview :

1Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Tree.ipynb

DATASET - Iris.
Implements Decision Tree Classifier for classification tasks.
Explores feature importance and visualization of decision boundaries.
The model predicts the type of iris flower from the following 'setosa', 'Virginia', and 'Versicolor' iris flower types. 


2Ô∏è‚É£ KNN.ipynb

DATASET - breast cancer.
Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification.
Covers distance metrics and optimal K selection.
The model predicts whether the breast cancer is of benign or malignant type.
